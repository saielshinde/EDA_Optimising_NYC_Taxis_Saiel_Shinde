1. Introduction
This report presents an analysis of NYC taxi operations based on trip data obtained from Parquet files. The analysis aims to extract meaningful insights on demand patterns, revenue trends, and optimization strategies for taxi dispatching and pricing.
2. Data Preparation
•	The dataset consists of multiple Parquet files, which were converted to CSV for easier processing.
•	Data was loaded in smaller chunks to handle memory constraints efficiently.
•	A sample of the data (1%) was extracted from each file to maintain a manageable dataset size.
3. Data Cleaning
•	Column names were standardized to lowercase and formatted properly.
•	Missing values were handled using median imputation (for numerical values) and mode imputation (for categorical values).
•	Outliers in key numerical columns like trip_distance, fare_amount, and tip_amount were identified and filtered using the interquartile range (IQR) method.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4.1 Pickup Distribution
•	Taxi pickups are highly concentrated during peak commuting hours: 8 AM - 9 AM and 5 PM - 7 PM.
•	Late-night pickups are more frequent in entertainment districts.
4.2 Monthly Revenue Trends
•	Revenue trends indicate higher earnings in the winter months, possibly due to increased ride demand.
•	Revenue dips in warmer months, which may suggest higher competition from alternative transport methods like biking or walking.
4.3 Relationship Between Distance and Fare
•	A positive correlation exists between trip_distance and fare_amount, although some short trips have high fares, likely due to congestion or extra charges.
4.4 Geospatial Analysis: Taxi Zones
•	Trip data was merged with NYC taxi zone shapefiles to analyze location-based demand.
•	The highest number of trips originate from transportation hubs like airports, Penn Station, and Grand Central Terminal.
5. Conclusion & Recommendations
5.1 Insights
1.	The majority of trips occur during peak commuting hours (8 AM - 9 AM, 5 PM - 7 PM).
2.	Revenue trends show higher earnings in the winter months, potentially due to increased ride demand.
3.	High-traffic zones are centered around major transit hubs and business districts.
4.	Longer trips generally have higher fares, but efficiency varies with congestion levels.
5.2 Optimizing Routing & Dispatching
•	Increase fleet deployment during peak hours in high-demand zones.
•	Use real-time traffic data to dynamically adjust routes and minimize travel time.
5.3 Strategic Cab Positioning
•	Position more taxis in nightlife districts and airports during late-night hours.
•	Adjust fleet distribution based on seasonal demand variations.
5.4 Data-Driven Pricing Strategy
•	Implement surge pricing during peak hours and special events to maximize revenue.
•	Offer discounts or incentives during off-peak hours to balance demand and increase utilization.
6. Final Summary
This analysis provides actionable insights into taxi demand patterns, revenue trends, and operational strategies. By implementing smart dispatching, strategic fleet positioning, and dynamic pricing models, NYC taxi operators can optimize efficiency and profitability.
